Reverly Labs

Always learning-

My interest in Reverly is about a desire to move into more digital work that’s about problem solving and working with a team that believes in geniune problem solving.

I’m aware I don’t have all the experience you’re asking for in the position. My digital experience has been limited to small projects under tight deadlines and limited recources. With the time given I would design the visual elements and work with the creative director and developer on the UX and UI with the knowledge we had. I’m always looking to learn, for me it's not about just building skills sets but personal growth.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

Brandon J Washington
